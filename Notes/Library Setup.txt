Steps I did:
 - Copy in the library to External/etc

Project properties:
  Debug:
    Debugging:
      Environment: PATH=%PATH%;$(ProjectDir)\External\SFML-2.5.1\lib\Debug\
    C/C++ -> General:
      Additional Include Directories: $(ProjectDir)\External\SFML-2.5.1\include;$(ProjectDir)
    Linker -> General:
      Additional Library Dependencies: $(ProjectDir)\External\SFML-2.5.1\lib\Debug\;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)
    Input:
      Additional Dependencies: sfml-graphics-d.lib;sfml-window-d.lib;sfml-system-d.lib;sfml-audio-d.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)
  Release - Same, but change all to the release versions.  No -d, etc.

--------------------------------
In theory, all the paths are relative.
So you should just need to copy-paste the solution to somewhere new...
