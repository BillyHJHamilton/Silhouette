We'll need a way to pausing the simulation.
And maybe slow motion, though player mechanics are currently per-frame rather than per time.
But some other things should still update.
This is a little tricky.

For example, when the player dies, I'd like to freeze the world and fade out.
Then display a "Game Over" text.
And listen for pressing Enter.
And then restart the world.

So the FadeOutComponent still needs to tick.
But other components shouldn't.

We could create a separate "UI Tick" that has receives a different delta time.
Or we could have a World->IsPaused and check it everywhere and eschew updates if it's true.
Or we could have Component->TicksWhenPaused.
Then we check that on each component.
And it could be overridded per instance if needed.
That might be the best for now.
